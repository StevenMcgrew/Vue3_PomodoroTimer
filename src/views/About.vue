        <h2>The Pomodoro Technique</h2>

        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s. It uses a
            timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval
            is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used
            as a university student.</p>

        <h2>Five steps of the Pomodoro Technique</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Decide on a task and set the timer (25 minutes is common).</li>
            <li>Work on the task during that time.</li>
            <li>When the timer rings, take a short break (5-10 minutes is common).</li>
            <li>Keep repeating Steps 1-3, but after your 4th task, take a long break instead of a short break (20-30
                minutes is common).</li>
            <li>Once the long break is finished, return to Step 1.</li>
        </ol>
